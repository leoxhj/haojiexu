My name is Scott Hanselman. I'm a programmer, teacher, and speaker. I work out of my home office in Portland, Oregon for the Web Platform Team at Microsoft, but this blog, its content and opinions are my own. I blog about technology, culture, gadgets, diversity, code, the web, where we're going and where we've been. I'm excited about community, social equity, media, entrepreneurship and above all, the open web.

I have three podcasts and a YouTube channel. One podcast is a weekly talk show on tech, one an occasional one hour essay on developer's lives, and one a social media and tech culture show with my friend Luvvie.

I would love it if you would subscribe to my blog's RSS feed. I'm also on Google+, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

If you just want to email me, go ahead send an email to scott@hanselman.com but be nice and make sure you Googled around a bit before you do. ;)

BACKGROUND

I was the Chief Architect at Corillian Corporation, now a part of Checkfree, for 6+ years. Before Corillian and Microsoft I worked as a Principal Consultant at STEP Technology, speaking, writing, consulting, and very much not getting rich during Web 1.0, although I worked on a bunch of web sites you have heard of. I've also been an Adjunct Professor at OIT, teaching C# and Web Services. I created the first PalmPilot Diabetes Management System in 1998 and sold it to a healthcare company some years later.

TOO MUCH INFORMATION

I am an early adopter, it seems. I ran Tweak Computer Support BBS, with some success, a very long time ago. I was a FidoNet node. I have nice teeth and love cheese amongst other things. I like Tools, and I've co-written some books. I'm diabetic. I like studying Amharic and Zulu/Ndebele and listening to African Music as well as other music. I enjoy Black Hair as a hobby and can both braid and cornrow, although more recently #teamnatural. I have a podcast. I hack on hardware and waste time. I do Open Source. I have a large forefive-head. I am good at Excel and keep my resume mostly up to date for no reason. We speak Sign Language to my son and my wife speaks Ndebele. I have a great family and have had great teachers and a fantastic wedding with a great Cake Topper. I don't sleep too much. I write a lot. I'm trying to raise $50,000 for Diabetes research.

That's me, today. I'll be different tomorrow, hopefully better.
